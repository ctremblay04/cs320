I thought this project was pretty interesting. The code for the predictors was not too difficult,
what was sort of interesting though was the design for the project. Each predictor exhibited 
very similar behaivor making this a great fit for object inheritence, and this really allowed 
me to get some good, practical practice with object oriented programming and using c++ templates.
